### FAQs

# Q: I'm not seeing an option for a dropdown menu that's appropriate for what I'm adding or editing, how do I add a new dropdown option?
A: All of the dropdown menu options have their own configuration pages where you can add, edit, or delete options. You'll find these under the "Digital Asset Categories" or "Builder Common" navigation sections.


# Q: Why won't it let me edit some fields?
A: Some fields are generated on the backend and cannot be changed without breaking something. These are generally fields that should not be editable after they're initially created. If you feel there's a field that's readonly that shouldn't be give your feedback to support and they'll either be able to tell you why it can't be editable or notify development that there's a change that should be made
