# Overview
### Syncing
The "Save and Sync" button has two functions. If no rows have been modified by the user it looks for new or updated entries from the cloud and syncs them with your local application. If rows have been modified by the user it syncs those changes with the cloud and performs the sync of new and/or updated entries from the cloud database.

### Editing from the grid view
You can edit rows directly from the grid view by double clicking on a row or by highlighing a row and then pressing F2.
After you're finished editing a row you can either click outside the row or hit enter. To save any changes you've made in
the grid view, press the Save and Sync button in the command bar above the grid.

### Sorting
You can sort the order of rows by clicking the column header and then clicking sort on the flyout that pops up. To reverse the sort order do it again.

### Grouping
You can group rows into collapsable segments by either clicking the column header and clicking group by on the flyout or by clicking and dragging the column header to the left edge of the table. You can group by multiple things by repeating the process. To change the order of the hierarchy, or to remove the grouping, click on the arrow in the top left of the table to open up a new panel. You can reorder the columns to change the grouping hierarchy and/or remove columns

### Filtering
You can filter the table by typing a search term into the search box on the command bar above the table. Hitting enter or clicking the magnifying glass will then filter the table.
To filter by only a specific column, click on a column header and then click filter to bring up the filter options

### Preview window for image columns
If you click on an image in a grid row it'll open up a large preview flyout window to more easily see the image

# FAQs

### Q: Why isn't column x on the grid view but it is on the details page?
A: To reduce clutter we've minimized the amount of columns displayed on the grid view. If there's a column that'd be really great to have in the grid view, let support know and they can forward feedback to the developers!

### Q: I'm not seeing an option for a dropdown menu that's appropriate for what I'm adding or editing, how do I add a new dropdown option?
A: All of the dropdown menu options have their own configuration pages where you can add, edit, or delete options. You'll find these under the "Digital Asset Categories" or "Builder Common" navigation sections.

### Q: I'm not seeing an entry that I had made or that someone else had made and was expecting to see. What can I do?
A: While all of the pages are set to automatically sync when you navigate them, sometimes records are added after that sync is performed and don't show up right away. You can click the "Sync and Save" button to sync with the database again and pull those records. If you are seeing no records at all, try navigating to the Settings page and clearing the local cache and trying again.
